This allowed me to successfully update my local environment.

Following this update, I have a few suggestions for improvements to the FlaskEnvManager dashboard to make it even more comprehensive and user-friendly:

1. Error Handling and Dependency Installation:

Issue: I've noticed that some files required for projects to run properly can be missing, and installing dependencies can be tedious.
Suggestion: Would it be possible to add a button or feature to:
Detect missing files (e.g., Python dependencies, configuration files) and download them automatically.
Install missing dependencies (e.g., by running `pip install` with the dependencies specified in a `requirements.txt` file).
A "Fix Errors" or "Install Dependencies" button could be added to each project in the dashboard.

2. Displaying configuration and documentation files:

Suggestion: To facilitate project management, would it be possible to add a feature to:
Automatically detect `README.md` files and configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`, `settings.ini`) present in each project directory.
Display the contents of these files directly in the dashboard, as a preview or as a link to a text editor.
Display a list of detected dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

3. Managing multiple projects simultaneously:

Question: Is it possible to launch multiple Flask projects simultaneously from the dashboard?
Suggestion: If possible, would it be possible to:
Allow the configuration of different ports for each project (e.g., 5000, 5001, 5002, etc.).
Display the ports used by each project in the dashboard. If not already added

4. Improve the user interface and documentation:

Suggestion: To make the dashboard more intuitive, would it be possible to add:
Tooltips or contextual guides next to input fields, buttons, and other interface elements.
A help or documentation section directly in the dashboard, explaining the various features and the steps to follow to manage projects.

A bilingual interface would also be appreciated: English/French
